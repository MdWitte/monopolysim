Simulation of the Monopoly board game


After an excruciating game of Monopoly, I decided to see for myself what the best strategy is for this game. By simulating the steps a player takes during a game, I can make an educated guess about which streets players are most likely to land on. Those streets you are going to want to buy if you get the chance.
